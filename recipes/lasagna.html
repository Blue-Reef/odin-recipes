<h3>List of ingredients & substitutions</h3>

<ul>

    <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Beaten eggs are mixed with the ricotta to allow it to 
    set, so that it doesn’t ooze out when you cut into the lasagna.</li>

    <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Use ricotta, parmesan and mozzarella to make this tomato lasagna. 
    The ricotta adds a great creamy texture, the parmesan gives a stronger and sharper cheese 
    flavor and the mozzarella creates those perfect cheese pulls</li>

    <li><strong>Seasoning/Aromatics:</strong> Fresh basil, fresh garlic salt and pepper</li>

    <li><strong>Spinach:</strong> This adds vegetables to the tomato lasagna to bulk it 
    up for the meatless option.</li>

    <li><strong>Lemon:</strong> The lemon juice and lemon zest add a burst of fresh 
    flavor, and the acid helps to cut through the creamy ricotta. </li>

    <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Heirloom tomatoes are perfect for the lasagna as they 
    are so much more flavorful than regular. In a pinch, large beefsteak tomatoes, 
    or vine-ripened will work well. slice them and layer them with the other ingredients.</li>

    <li><strong>Lasagna:</strong> Use no-boil lasagna sheets for this recipe. 
    The moisture in the rest of the dish will cook the sheets</li>

    <li><strong>Tomato sauce:</strong> Use plain tomato sauce for that authentic lasagna 
    flavor or make your own marinara from scratch.</li>

</ul>
