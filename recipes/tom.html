<h1>Pasta with Cherry Tomatoes</h1>

    Once you try this, you’ll see why this has been my go-to pasta dish 
    most of the summer. It has a fresh, light, and vegan sauce that comes 
    out silky smooth with a nice balance of sweetness and tanginess from 
    the tomatoes. After you’re done cooking the cherry tomatoes and tossing 
    with the pasta, you can keep it vegan or add some shaved parmesan cheese 
    when serving.

<h3>Ingredients to make pasta with cherry tomatoes</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cherry tomatoes:</strong> You’ll need about two pints of cherry tomatoes for this recipe.
     If you can’t find cherry tomatoes, you could use grape tomatoes or even regular diced 
     tomatoes.</li>

     <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> I always say the more garlic, the better, but start 
        with at least three cloves and go from there.</li>

    <li><strong>Red pepper flakes:</strong> These are totally optional, but I like a little 
        bit of heat in my pasta. Start with ½ teaspoon and add more to taste.</li>

    <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> You’ll need some really good olive oil. 
        I like to use organic extra virgin olive oil because the flavor really comes through in 
        this dish. The sauce will really only be made up of the olive oil, minced garlic, and 
        the juices that will come from the ripe sweet tomatoes literally bursting in the pan.
        </li>

    <li><strong>Basil:</strong> You really want to use fresh basil here. It’s so much better than
         dried basil when the recipe calls for minimal ingredients, and really makes a 
         difference in the flavor of the dish.</li>

    <li><strong>Parmesan cheese:</strong> This is also optional, but I love the salty, sharp 
        flavor that parmesan cheese adds to this pasta. If you’re keeping it vegan, 
        you could use Nutritional Yeast.</li>

    <li><strong>Salt:</strong> You’ll need to add some salt to help bring out the dish’s flavors.</li>

    <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> You can really use any type of pasta you like. I’ve made it with 
        spaghetti, angel hair, and even shells. It’s really up to you!</li>
</ul>
