<h1>Cheesey Lemon Orzo</h1>

<p> 
    If I can get away with using just one pot to cook dinner on a weeknight, I will. That’s part of the reason 
    I love this one pan lemon orzo: it only requires a Dutch oven. First, garlic and shallots are sautéed, then 
    the orzo is added and toasted—which adds so much flavor—and then the pasta’s cooked with lemon juice and zest 
    and stock until everything is soft and creamy. And that’s before the cheeses are stirred in! I will often just 
    scoop it into a bowl and enjoy it on its own, but this Cheesy Lemon Orzo is also delicious served with roast
    chicken and salmon.

<h3>Ingredients to make Cheesey Lemon Orzo</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> For more flavor, opt for extra virgin olive oil. Instead of olive oil, you could 
    use canola, vegetable, avocado, or even coconut oil</li>

    <li><strong>Shallots and garlic:</strong> Diced shallots and minced garlic are going to add a ton of flavor. A shallot 
    is like a smaller, milder onion.</li>

    <li><strong>Orzo:</strong> This is a short type of pasta that looks a lot like rice. It has a chewy texture and I love 
    it in warm or cold dishes, like this Mediterranean Orzo Salad.</li>

    <li><strong>Salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes:</strong> I keep the spices simple in this Cheesy Lemon Orzo. They help the 
    other ingredients stand out, but won’t overpower them! </li>

    <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Using stock instead of water to cook the pasta adds a ton of flavor! You can use chicken or vegetable 
    stock (or broth if that’s what you can find).</li>

    <li><strong>Lemon:</strong> Bright and punchy, you’ll use both the lemon zest and juice in this recipe.</li>

    <li><strong>Baby spinach:</strong> While a whole container of baby spinach might seem like a lot, it will shrink down a ton when 
    1it’s stirred in</li>

    <li><strong>Peas:</strong> I almost always have frozen peas on hand. If you have fresh peas, though, you can use those.</li>

    <li><strong>Ricotta and parmesan cheeses:</strong> These make the dish creamy (it’s both a texture and a flavor!).</li>

</ul>

<h3>How to make Cheesey Lemon Orzo</h3>

<ol>
    <li> In a Dutch oven, sauté the shallots until softened, then add the garlic, 
    cooking until it smells fragrant (keep an eye on it so the garlic doesn’t burn!).</li>

    <li> Add the orzo, stirring and toasting until it smells nutty.</li>

    <li> Add the salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, stock, and lemon zest and 
    juice and bring to a boil. Then cover and reduce the heat (stirring occasionally) until all the 
    pasta absorbs all of the stock.</li>

    <li> Add the veggies, stirring until the spinach wilts and the peas are warmed through.</li>

    <li> Add the cheeses</li>

    <li> Stir until the cheeses are melted and thoroughly mixed in and the lemon orzo is creamy.</li>
