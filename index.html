</a>
<p>
    Quick, easy, and absolutely amazing, this Pasta with Cherry Tomatoes is one of 
    my favorite easy weeknight meals and a great way to use up a lot of tomatoes! 
    Fresh, plump cherry tomatoes make the most amazing pasta sauce in combination with
    earthy garlic,salt, and bright red pepper flakes. Topped with fresh basil and parmesan, 
    it’s a simple pasta dinner recipe that will quickly become a family favorite!

<p>
    This Cheesy Lemon Orzo is the kind of recipe I’ll happily eat a whole 
    bowl of and call it a meal. It’s lemony, creamy, and has plenty of veggies.
